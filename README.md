# XrmToolBox Plugin - Export to Excel
This is a plugin for XrmToolBox. The code is based on the View Layout Replicator.

# Why did I develop this tool?
Even though you can export records from Dynamics CRM, there is a record count limitation. The upper limit is 100,000 in CRM 2015 Update 1 -> http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/dynamics/crm-customer-center/export-data-to-excel.aspx

This tool can be used to overcome that limitation, as it just pages through RetrieveMultiple till there are no more records to retrieve.

#Install Instructions
Download the most recent version of XrmToolBox. Click on the "Plugin Store" button in the menu and install this tool from the store.

# Credits
Tanguy for View Layout Replicator - Most of the UI and event handling code is from this tool.
